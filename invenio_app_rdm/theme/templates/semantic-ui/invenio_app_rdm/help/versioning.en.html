          <p>What is DOI versioning?</p>
        </h5>
        <p>DOI versioning allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>edit/update the record’s files after they have been published.</li>
          <li>cite a specific version of a record.</li>
          <li>cite all of versions of a record.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>
          <p>How does DOI versioning work?</p>
        </h5>
        <p>
          When you publish an upload for the first time, we register two DOIs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a DOI representing the <strong>specific version</strong> of your record.
          </li>
          <li>
            a DOI representing <strong>all of the versions</strong> of your record.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Afterwards, we register a DOI for every new version of your upload.</p>
        <p>
          This is best illustrated by an example of a software package. If the
          software has been released in two versions (v1.0 and v1.1), then
          the following DOIs would have been registered:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>v1.0 (specific version):</strong> 10.1234/7s0da-05p39</li>
          <li><strong>v1.1 (specific version):</strong> 10.1234/chc5z-w0r30</li>
          <li><strong>Concept (all versions):</strong> 10.1234/3s67k-pd636</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The first two DOIs for versions <strong>v1.0</strong> and
          <strong>v.1.1</strong> represent the specific versions of the software.
          The last DOI represents all the versions of the given software package,
          i.e. the concept of the software package and the ensemble of versions. We
          therefore also call the them <strong>Version DOIs</strong> and
          <strong>Concept DOIs</strong> (note, technically both are just normal
          DOIs).
        </p>
        <p>
          You may notice that the version DOIs do not include a “.v1”-suffix. Read
          below to find out why.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <p>Which DOI should I use in citations?</p>
        </h5>
        <p>
          You should normally always use the DOI for the
          <strong>specific version</strong> of your record in citations. This is to
          ensure that other researchers can access the
          <strong>exact</strong> research artefact you used for reproducibility. By
          default, we use the specific version to generate citations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the Concept DOI representing all versions in citations when it
          is desirable to cite an evolving research artifact, without being specific
          about the version.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <p>Where does the Concept DOI resolve to?</p>
        </h5>
        <p>
          The Concept DOI resolves to the landing page of the latest
          version of your record.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ui eight wide column">
        <h5>
          <p>
            I only want to change the title of my upload, do I still get a new DOI?
          </p>
        </h5>
        <p>
          No, you can continue to edit the metadata of your upload without
          creating a new version of a record. You should only create a new version
          if you want to update the files of your record.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <p>Why don’t the DOIs have a version number suffix like “.v1”?</p>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Including semantic information such as the version number in a DOI is bad
          practice, because this information may change over time, while DOIs must
          remain persistent and should not change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, DOI versioning is linear, which means that the version number may
          in fact not be the real version number of the resource.
          Take for instance software, where it is common practice to have dot
          versions and make new releases in a non-linear order (e.g. first v1.0,
          then v1.1, then v2.0, then v1.2).
        </p>
        <p>
          The versioning suffix is also not a functionality of the DOI system, i.e.
          adding .v2 to a DOI will not resolve to version 2 of a resource for any DOI
          from any provider. Different providers also use different patterns such as
          e.g. .v2, .2, /2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, version suffixes are not machine readable. A discovery
          system that understands DOIs, will not know that .v1 and .v2 of a DOI are
          in fact two versions of the same resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          A better solution to this problem is to semantically link two DOIs in the
          metadata of a DOI. This ensures that discovery systems have a
          machine-readable way to discover that two DOIs are versions of the same
          resource.

        </p>

        <h5>
          <p>Do you duplicate all the files for every new version of a record?</p>
        </h5>
        <p>
          No, if you change a 10kb README file in 50GB dataset we do not duplicate
          the entire 50GB dataset. InvenioRDM, the underlying technical software
          platform, efficiently handles the file storage so we only store the new
          extra 10kb.
