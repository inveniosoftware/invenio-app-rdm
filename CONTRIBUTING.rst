Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `invenio-app-rdm` for local development.

1. Fork the `inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/invenio-app-rdm.git

3. Install your local copy. Assuming you have
   `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/install/#installing-pipenv>`_, installed, this is how you
   set up your fork for local development:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd invenio-app-rdm/
      $ pipenv run install -e .[all]

4. Create a branch for local development:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass tests:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ./run-tests.sh

   The tests will provide you with test coverage and also check PEP8
   (code style), PEP257 (documentation), flake8 as well as build the Sphinx
   documentation and run doctests.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git add .
      $ git commit -s
          -m "component: title without verbs"
          -m "* NEW Adds your new feature."
          -m "* FIX Fixes an existing issue."
          -m "* BETTER Improves and existing feature."
          -m "* Changes something that should not be visible in release notes."
      $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests and must not decrease test coverage.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
